\section*{Question 1}

$P^0(i,j)$ is the set of all paths from i to j with no intermediate vertices.
$P^0(i,j)$ is empty if no direct edge between i and j otherwise it contains the direct edge from i to j.
$\delta^0(i,j)$ is infinity if no direct edge between i and j otherwise the weight of the direct edge from i to j. 
\\
$P^n(i,j)$ is the set of all paths from i to j with no constraint on the intermediate vertices. 
Hence , $\delta^n(i,j)$ is the shortest distance between i and j. 
\\
$P^k{i,j}$ is the set of all paths from i to j with intermediate vertices of label atmost k .It can be partitioned into two sets. All the paths containing k as an intermediate vertex belong to one set . The rest of the paths have intermediate vertex of label at most k-1. They belong to the other set.
\\
$P^k(i,j) = P^{k-1}(i,j) \cup X $ where X =  \{The set of all paths from i to j with intermediate vertex k\} 
The shortest distance in $P^k(i,j)$ is the minimum of the shortest distance in $P^{k-1}(i,j)$ and X. \\
The shortest distance in $P^{k-1}(i,j)$ is $\delta^{k-1}(i,j)$ . \\
The paths in X have the following structure : \\
Every path in X is a concatenation of some path from i to k and then from k to j. \\
The shortest path in X would be the concatenation of the shortest path from i to k and shortest path from k to j. \\
Hence, the shortest distance in X is $\delta^{k-1}(i,k) + \delta^{k-1}(k,j)$. \\

\subsection*{Recursive Formulation:}

\[
\ \delta^0(i,j) = w(i,j) if (i,j) \in E else \inf 
\]

\[
\ \delta^k(i,i) = 0
\]

\[
\ \delta^k(i,j) = min ( \delta^{k-1}(i,j) , \delta^{k-1}(i,k) + \delta^{k-1}(k,j) )
\]

\begin{algorithm}
// Initially , k = 0 \; 
\For {i in 1 to n}{
	\For{j in 1 to n}{
		
		\If{$(i,j) \in E$}{ 
			$\delta[i,j] \leftarrow w(i,j)$ \; 		
		}
		\Else{
			$\delta[i,j] \leftarrow \infty$ \;
		}	
	}
}
\For{k in 1 to n}{
	\For{i in 1 to n}{
		\For{j in 1 to n}{
			\If{$\delta[i,k] + \delta[k,j] < \delta[i,j]$}{
			$\delta[i,j] \leftarrow \delta[i,k] + \delta[k,j])$ \;
			}
		}
	}
}

\end{algorithm}

\subsection*{Analysis: }

1st nested loop is $O(n^2)$ \\
2nd nested loop is $O(n^3)$ \\
Hence , total time complexity is $O(n^3)$ \\

For calculating the matrix for kth case , we can overwrite the matrix of k-1th case. \\
Hence , space required is only the size of nxn matrix i.e $O(n^2)$


\subsection*{Paths :}

During the bottom up build , the shortest path between i to j changes only when it has k as its intermediate vertex.
Otherwise , it remains the same.
The shortest path between i and j is either a direct edge from i to j or it is the shortest path from i to k and then k to j.
Hence , to report the shortest path from i to j , all we need is vertex k .
Shortest Path from i to j is computed by recursively reporting the shortest path from i to k and then the shortest path from k to j. \\

\begin{algorithm}
// Initially , k = 0 \; 
\For {i in 1 to n}{
	\For{j in 1 to n}{
		$P[i,j] \leftarrow null$ \;  
		\If{$(i,j) \in E$}{ 
			$\delta[i,j] \leftarrow w(i,j)$ \; 		
		}
		\Else{
			$\delta[i,j] \leftarrow \infty$ \;
		}	
	}
}
\For{k in 1 to n}{
	\For{i in 1 to n}{
		\For{j in 1 to n}{
			\If{$\delta[i,k] + \delta[k,j] < \delta[i,j]$}{
			$\delta[i,j] \leftarrow \delta[i,k] + \delta[k,j])$ \;
			$P[i,j] \leftarrow k$ \;
			}
		}
	}
}    


\caption{\textsc{All Pair Shortest Path - Paths}}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection*{Analysis: }
Same as the previous algorithm\\
Time complexity is $O(n^3)$ \\
Space requirement is $O(n^2)$ \\

\begin{algorithm}
\If{$\delta[i,j] = \infty$}{
	print "no path exists between i and j" \;
}
\If{$P[i,j] = null$}{
	print " " \; // direct edge between i and j
}
\Else{
	print $ReportPath(i,P[i,j]) + P[i,j] + ReportPath(P[i,j],j)$ \; 
}
\caption{\textsc{ReportPath(i,j)}}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection*{Analysis: }
If there is no path between i and j , the algorithm prints "no path" in constant time . \\
If the shortest path between i and j has t vertices , at each recursive call , one intermediate vertex is printed.
Hence reporting all the vertices in the path takes time of the order of number of edges in the path .\\
