\section*{Question 2}
\begin{claim}
All the edges removed by the attacker will belong to some min-cut.
\label{mincut}
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
It is given that each node lies on atleast one path from $s-t$.
From the max-flow , min-cut theorem , the size of min-cut is k. Consider a cut as follows :

The cut divides the graph into two partitions $s \in A$ and $t \in A'$ , such that for any edge $(u,v)$ removed $u \in A$ and $v \in A'$. Also $\forall v' \in A'$ , $t$ is reachable from $v'$ and $\forall u' \in A $ , $u'$ is reachable from $s$ , as no such edge $(x,y)$ is removed whose both end points lie either in $A$ or in $A'$.

If the size of this cut is greater than k , then $\exists (x,y) \in E$ not removed by the attacker such that $x \in A$ and $y \in A'$.
since $x$ is reachable from $s$ and $t$ is reachable from $y$ , and edge $(x,y)$ is not removed , so $t$ is reachable from $s$ , which leads to contradiction. 

Hence the size of this cut is k. Thus it is a min-cut.
\end{proof}

\begin{claim}
Any edge $(u,v)$ is removed by the attacker if and only if $ping(u)$ is true and $ping(v)$ is false. 
\label{ping}
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
if part :

$(u,v)$ is removed by the attacker so $u \in A$ and $v \in A'$.

$ping(u)$ is true follows trivially from the fact that $u \in A$.

If all the edges of the above min-cut are removed then there is no path from any vertex in $A$ to any vertex in $A'$. 
As $s \in A$ and $v \in A'$, so $ping(v)$ is false.

only if part :

Suppose $(u,v)$ be such edge with $ping(u)$ = true and $ping(v)$ = false.

$v$ can not belong to $A$ as all vertices in $A$ are reachable from $s$. Similarly $u$ can not belong to $A'$ , if $u$ belonged to $A'$ then there is a path from $u$ to $t$ from the property of $A'$ and there is a path from $s$ to $u$ as $ping(u)$ is true , so there is a path from $s$ to $t$ which is contradiction. 

Thus $u \in A$ and $v \in A'$ , since this edge forms a part of the min-cut edges so it would have been removed by the attacker.

\end{proof}

do a dfs on $G'$ from $s$ to find all vertices reachable from $s$ which will form the set $A$. \;
$V-A = A'$ which is the set of vertices not reachable from $s$. \;

\end{algorithm}
\subsection*{Order of ping requests}
Since length of any $s-t$ path can not be greater than $n$ and we are issuing requests in binary search fashion. 
So number of ping requests in the inner while loop is $O(log n)$.
Since for loop is repeated k times, so total number of ping requests are $O(k logn)$.

\subsection*{Correctness of Algorithm}
\begin{claim}
Every $s-t$ path we are guaranteed to find an edge $(u,v)$ which is removed by the attacker.
\end{claim}
\begin{proof}
Let there be no such edge , then in the new Graph after removing the attacked edges , all the edges of this path exist. So there is a $s-t$ path which leads to contradiction. 
\end{proof}

So in every iteration , the path we find , we are guaranteed to find an edge $(u,v)$ which is present in this path and is removed by the attacker. This edge is found by the binary search algorithm using the claim $\ref{ping}$. So every iteration we are removing one edge which is actually attacked by the attacker. 

We are also guaranteed to find a $s-t$ path in every iteration as $k$ is the minimum number of edges to be removed to separate $s$ and $t$ and we are running for loop only $k$ number of times. So after $k$ iterations we find $k$ edges which are actually attacked by the attacker. So the graph $G'$ consist of only edges actually present in the network after the attack. Now simple dfs from $s$ finds the vertices actually reachable from $s$ which forms the set $A$ . $V-A=A'$ forms the set of vertices not reachable from $s$.
